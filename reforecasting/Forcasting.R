# 1. Linear model

# Before we apply time series model, lets check with linear regression.
# First thing first, need to check the linear model assumption whether we can apply it

# 1) Endogenous of the residual term (dependency btw residuals and covariates)
# Here, I just check the covariance of the two terms.
cov(lm(val ~ year, data = tot)$residuals,tot$year)
# Result: it is very close to the zero, that means residuals are independent 
# from the covariate.

# 2) Autocorrelation of the residual.
# Here I introduced durbinwatson test. e(t) = rho*e(t-1) + v(t)
durbinWatsonTest(lm(val ~ year, data = tot))
# we cannot reject the H0 : residuals are not auto-correlated.

# So lets try linear model.

# Here I added some notes based on the residual visualization. 
# Generally, we test the model performance by residual analysis.
# Explanation and information extracted from the plot written below

# plot 1 (residuals vs fitted)
# We can observe that it is slightly curved.
# plot 2 (Normal QQ plot)

# observation 1 and 8 has a significant influence on the model,
# that means if we remove those observations, the model would have a significant changes.
# However, I didt remove and try the new model since we only have 10 data points.
# Hence, based on all the facts above, I wont recommend this model.
# we can do some changes based on the linear model, however, it is not necessary
# in our case since we dont want much advaced model.

# So lets start our time series trip, here I explained step by step for 
# total immigration. and for others, just simply explained, if you have any questions,
# feel free to ask me.

# 1) test the serial correlation

lag_length = 9 # number of lag we use in the test.

# Test whether any of a group of autocorrelations of a time series are different from zero.
Box.test(tsdata, lag=lag_length, type="Ljung-Box")
# Result : Here when Lag = 2-9, we cannot reject the hypothesis assuming the data are independently distributed.
# However, keep in mind that we only can say that we dont have sufficient information to reject the
# null hypothesis, but we cannot say that alternative hypothesis is true.

# Tips: In general, what is important here is to keep in mind that p-value < 0.05 
# lets you reject of the null-hypothesis, but a p-value > 0.05 does not let you 
# confirm the null-hypothesis.

# When lag = 1, it seems the process has a group autocorrelations.
# (From this one we also can see that auto-regressive part of the ARIMA model might be 1)

# In second, Before apply time-series model, we need to have a stationary process, 
# otherwise no matter what model you apply, it wont work well.

# 2) Test the process whether Stationary

# From the visualization, I find the non-stationary pattern, for further step
# lets try a statistical test. Here I introduced unit-root test.
# unit root test (If a process have unit root that means it is not stationary)
adf.test(tsdata)
# we cannot reject the hypothesis that assume the process has unit root.
# Result: the process maybe non-stationary (The series has the unit root)
# After the visualization and the test result, 
# I consider the TS is not a stationary process.

# As you can see from the plot, we have two issues
# a) variance changing over time (you also can use sqrt function, it depends on the curve)
# b) we have an increasing trend of immigration.


# a) So first removing the unequal variance by using log function

# b) Second, address the trend component by using First/second order difference.
# Because first order still does not give us a stationary process

# Lets implement the test again with first difference
adf.test(diff(log(tsdata), d = 1), alternative="stationary", k=0)
# Second difference
adf.test(diff(log(tsdata), d = 2), alternative="stationary", k=0)

# so second difference strongly make the process stationary. However, again it doesnt
# mean that with first difference the process in not stationary 
# (again tricky statistical test definition).
