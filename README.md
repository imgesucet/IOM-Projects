to already pull what we already have in the repository you must use the pull button on the top right hand of the console where it says 'Git'. this will update to what we have pushed into our repository. To push new files you must save the new work that you have updated, and click on 'Commit' which is located on the top legend under the 'Git'. after leaving a comment of what you have changed you must press 'commit' and it will upload to Github.
