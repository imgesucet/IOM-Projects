# Google Trends Index:

Google Trends is an online based and freely accessible application that provides the frequency with which the given query has been entered in the Google Search in relation to the total search volume.

Each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents to compare relative popularity.This means that when we look at search interests over time for a topic, weâ€™re looking at interests as a proportion of all searches on all topics on Google at the time and location.

# Forecasting

This is a good website to check out for forecasting google trend searches

```{r}
#I used prophet for easy forecastin. We can expand with other methods.
install.packages('prophet')
library(prophet)

#Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.

# for simple computation I have used US as origin and CANADA as destination. As an english speaking country, we are able to search
